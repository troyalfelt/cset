1. In your opinion, what is the most important thing you learned this week? Why?
  
  The most valuable concept I learned this week is how simply computers think and how specific you need to be in your instructions to them. No matter what language or project you are working on, you need to be able to think like a machine. 

2. Describe the general idea of high and low level programming languages using the concept of abstraction.
  
  A computer is only capable of thinking in terms of 1s and 0s in the form of electricity or no eletricity. Every piece of data a computer uses, from images to numbers to sounds, is represented in these binary terms. A low-level programming language uses only 1s and 0s to instruct the computer and is difficult for humans to read. A high-level programming language uses abstraction to make code simpler and more legible for humans. Abstraction is the process of taking pieces of code and representing them in simpler terms. For example, the 'while' construct tells the computer to do something while a condition is met. This hides the binary process in the background and is far easier to write and interpert than raw 1s and 0s. 

3. JavaScript was designed to be flexible with values and types, often jumping back and forth between them. Compare some pros and cons of this decision. How might it help you? How might it get in the way?
  
  The flexibility of JavaScript can be both beneficial and a detriment. Where other languages would return an error, JavaScript coerces the types of values to resolve the issue. This can make detecting mistakes difficult because JavaScript will not point out where you may have say, forgotten to convert something to a string. On the other hand, this ability allows you to accomplish things in JavaScript you would not have otherwise been able to. This behavior can let you test if a value has been assigned an actual value or if it is equal to null.
