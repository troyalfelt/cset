1. After two weeks, what do you think is going to be your biggest challenge with this program? And how will you try to overcome it?
  
  I am a very disorganized person, so the part of programming I am most worried about is following the style guides and making my code readable. 
  I am trying to form good habits regarding program structure and style conventions from the beginning. If I form the habits now, they will come naturally
  to me down the line. 

2. Describe the differences between the three styles of loops: for, while, and do...while.
 
 A `while` loop has three components. A condition the program checks, a block of code that executes when the condition is met, and change the program makes
  before checking the condition again. A `for` loop has all these elements in a more succinct package. However, a 'for' loop is less flexible in when it breaks
  and should be used when the programmer knows how many times a program is going to loop. A `while` loop should be used when the number of iterations is unknown.
  A `do` loop is similar to a `while`, except it will always execute its code at least once before checking for the specified condition. A `while` loop may never
  execute if the condition is not met.

3. We've learned to split problem solving into two parts: writing the solution in English or pseudocode, then translating the solution into JavaScript. 
Why is this important and how will it help you in future classes?

  Beginning to solve a program in pseudocode makes finding a solution to the problem much easier because we think in English. If we solve the problem in human terms
  and then translate it into code, we also make it easier to find problems with our program. If the program gives us a different result than what we wanted, we know 
  the problem lies with our algorithm and we solved the problem incorrectly in the pseudocode half. If the program breaks when we run it, we know the problem lies in
  the translation into code.
