1. What do you think will be the most difficult aspect of developing a project in a larger team?

  
  I believe the hardest part will be interperting and adding to code other people have written.
  Already with our small forays into working with other people's code, it's been difficult to adjust
  to different organizational styles and problem solving methods. I already can't remember the names
  of variables I created, and that will only get worse with more people working on a project. 
 
 
2. Briefly describe a branch and a remote. Compare the defaults to examples that you created.

  
  A branch is a series of commits. A commit is a snapshot of the code in a moment in time, and with a 
  whole branch of them, you navigate the stages of development. A remote is a copy of a project's code 
  repository that is held on another machine, often an aggregater like github. When we made pull requests
  for other people's projects, we created a new branch on our project to work on new features. This 
  branch would reflect the person's code on github, which was the remote. 
  

3. For the collaborative project this week, which git workflow(s) did you employ? Why?

  
   This week, I utilized a feature branch workflow. There were two seperate pull requests
   we had to create, both based on the person's original code. That meant making a different
   branch to work on each of the two features inpdependently of one another. Then I made pull requests
   for the features to be merged into the person's master branch.
