1. This is your last assessment of the semester. Overall, how comfortable would you feel 
   answering questions like these in job interviews? Have they helped more than regular tests or quizzes?
   
   These questions have been more helpful to me than traditional tests. By explaining the concepts we have
   learned about, I can guarantee I understand them, and occasionally have realized I do not and have to go back
   to do more reading. In a job interview, I feel confident I could explain the basics of all the concepts we 
   have learned up to this point
  
   
2. In the readings this week, you learned a sampling of client-side tooling. Choose one tool that 
   you think will be the most beneficial for you. Explain what it does and why that's important.
   
   
   The tool I see being most useful to me is prettier. Prettier is a code formatter that does things
   like make sure your indentation is correct and there are semicolons where there should be.
   You can also create your own formatting rules with it. Following the style guidlines of coding
   and staying organized are difficult for me, and prettier can help keep code consistent and clean.
 
 
3. Compare the different stages of the Waterfall and Agile methodologies using the Tic-Tac-Toe 
   game as an example.
   
   
   Both methodologies start with the design phase. This means gathering requirements and resoures
   for the project. In the tic-tac-toe project, this meant defining what was needed for the game
   and how a game was won. Next comes implementation. With an agile style, many parts of the project
   are worked on in small chunks. In tic-tac-toe, this translated to spending a day designing and coding
   the grid, then the next day doing the same for win conditions. A waterfall approach would have 
   all the implementation be done at once before starting the next phase, verification. Verification means
   testing the code for bugs and making sure it meets requirements. In the waterfall method, this would only
   happen after all the code has been implemented. With agile, each chunk is individually tested. Finally comes
   maintenance. Maintenance for both methods is roughly the same, and can only occur after the final product has
   been delivered.
